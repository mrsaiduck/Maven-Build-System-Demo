Build systems automate the process of compiling source code into executable programs.
A build system manages dependencies, runs tests, and packages the final artifact.
Maven is a popular build system for Java projects.
Maven uses a declarative approach where you describe what you want, not how to build it.
The build lifecycle in Maven consists of phases like compile, test, package, and install.
Each phase is made up of plugin goals that do the actual work.
Dependencies are downloaded automatically from remote repositories like Maven Central.
A key advantage of build systems is reproducibility — every developer gets the same build.
Without a build system, managing dependencies and compilation by hand becomes error-prone.
Modern build systems like Maven make it easy to build, test, and deploy Java applications.
